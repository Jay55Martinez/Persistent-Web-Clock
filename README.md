# Persistent-Web-Clock-
I want a website where I can start a stopwatch. If I go to another browser and log into the website then I want the stopwatch to still be going and up to date. I need 3 functions: a way to name the purpose of the stopwatch, a way to start the clock, a way to pause the clock, and a way to restart the clock.
